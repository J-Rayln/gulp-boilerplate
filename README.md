# Basic Gulp/Sass Boilerplate

This is a basic boilerplate that uses Sass and a Gulp 4 workflow. Most files are commented fairly well with what they do. Check them out for more information.

**Note that the current version of the Sass files still uses the `@import` method. Future versions will change to using `@forard` and `@use`.**

See this link for more information on the deprecation of `@import`.
